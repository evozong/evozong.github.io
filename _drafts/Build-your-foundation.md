To be a great software engineer, it is not sufficient to only know how to code. You ___must___ understand the fundamentals of Computer Science. Here's a non-exhaustive list of fundamental concepts you're expected to understand:

- Data Structures
- Algorithms and Recursion
- Complexity Analysis
- Basic Network Routing and Protocols
- Computer Hardware
- Operating System Fundamentals
- Database and Schema Design
- System Design Language (UML)
- Design Patterns and Principles

A great chef must understand his seasonings and how to match flavors together. A great sailor must know how to navigate the seas. A great doctor must have a deep understanding of the human anatomy.

There's no need to get a PhD in those topics, but if you haven't at least taken an introductory course to each of the concepts above, it would be difficult to hold your own in deeper design discussions expected of a Senior Engineer.
