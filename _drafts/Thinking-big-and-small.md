One of the bigger self-reflections that the senior leadership have been doing recently is what Suresh called “Program thinking vs Project thinking”. Suresh thinks that we as an organization need to start thinking more about executing “Programs” of improvement rather than “Projects” to improve. What’s the difference? 

A “Project” usually has a well-defined problem and target. We know the problem and how we want to solve it, so we engage teams and people to attack the problem until it is solved. An example of a Project is “We know Watcher doesn’t have the Yard Audit feature, so let’s build it”. Here we have a well-defined problem (lack of the Yard Audit process in Watcher), and a well-defined target (let’s build the thing). 

A “Program” has a larger surface area: It’s generally a “theme” of problems, often not very well-defined, and definitely doesn’t have one straightforward answer to it. An example of a Program is “How do we reduce the number of places associates have to intervene during their yard management shift?” Notice that in that question I haven’t said anything at all about Yard Audits. Phrasing the question this way helps us think more big-picture to understand how we can solve it more effectively. 

So how does this apply to you?

Program thinking, at the engineers level, means a broad understanding of the entire product that you’re responsible for, the strengths and weaknesses and problems that your product creates for the operations team, and products that your team interacts with, and applying that broad level of understanding to every problem you solve. 

Say you were tasked to solve the problem of diverting packages in NV1 with an automatic sorter. You can create a solution that is very focused to the Project (these are the things I have to do to make it work in NV1), or you can extend the problem into a Program and think about similar situations that we’re going to encounter in other related areas (Can we put a sorter in a Sort Center? What about a RDC? What if we had a sorter in STORES, how would that help them? And finally, how would I solve the problem if I had to solve this whole class of problems instead of just solving for NV1?). Every one of us can and should contribute that level of thinking, and this can help Watcher become better as a product as well. 

But thinking at a program level can cause problems as well. Specifically, thinking at such a large scale will very likely cause you to come up with a solution that does too much, takes too long to build, and we’re not even sure if the solution will solve the original problem. So I want to introduce you another concept: Program thinking needs to be combined with Project execution. What does that mean? 

After we’ve searched through a “Program” space and brainstormed ways to solve the general class of problems, we need to understand what it takes to build such a system. What are the major risks and unknowns that may force you to reconsider your general solution? What is the minimum work you have to do to eliminate those risks? And, of all the parts of the grand solution you’ve envisioned, which are the minimum bits that will help you solve the immediate, actual problem? Once you have thought through all of that, you’ll come down to what is essentially a “Project” that you now can execute to solve the immediate problem quickly for the business, but also pave the way to solve the more general “Program” of problems for the future of the business.
