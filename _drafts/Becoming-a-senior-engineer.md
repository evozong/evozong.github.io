You've been in the software industry a few years, written lots of code, and now you want to became a "Senior Software Engineer". How do you know if you're one?

As an Engineering Manager, I've encountered this question many times. Today, I will share with you how I decide when an engineer becomes a "Senior Software Engineer". Note, ranks differ from company to company so this bar might be higher or lower where you work, but this is a general guideline for most of the industry.

# What makes a Software Engineer "Senior"?

There are a few major points I look for when deciding to hire or promote someone into the Senior band.

- [Solid CS Fundamentals](#cs_fundamentals)
- [Independence](#independence)
- [Teamwork](#teamwork)
- [Effectiveness of Contribution](#contribution)
- [Consistency](#consistency)
- [(Bonus) Known for "something"](#known_for)

## <span class="bookmark" id="cs_fundamentals"></span>Solid CS Fundamentals
A senior engineer has made more mistakes than a rookie engineer has successes. To show that you're a senior engineer, you need to make very few rookie mistakes, and the best way to not do that is to have solid fundamentals.

This is the most important trait of a Senior Software Engineer. If you don't have good CS fundamentals, you will never become a Senior.

## <span class="bookmark" id="independence"></span>Independence
When you are a junior engineer, I expect to spend lots of time with you, but as you grow, I expect you to need less handholding.

Independence comes in different forms, both technical and non-technical. On the technical front, if I keep correcting your implementation ideas ([pointing to insufficient CS Fundamentals](#cs_fundamentals)), you're not yet Senior. On the non-technical side, if I have to keep following up with you about when a piece of work is done or the problems you're facing, you're not mature enough to be a Senior.

These are just examples; the general idea behind assessing for independence can be summarized as: "Do I need to spend a lot of time with the engineer to make sure that he/she is successful?". The less time I need to spend with you, the more I believe you are Senior Engineer material.

## <span class="bookmark" id="independence"></span>Teamwork
No man is an island. We work as a team, and nobody knows everything. Knowing _when_ and _how_ to ask for help is very important part of working in a Software Engineering team.

Why do I say _when_ and _how_? Everyone will learn _when_ to ask for help at some point, but _how_ to ask for help is a lot harder: it requires you to understand how to communicate effectively with different people. If someone only begrudgingly helps you, it's because they are Senior, not because you are Senior.

The flip side of asking for help is giving help, and that is also part of teamwork. I expect Senior Software Engineers to help others when asked, _and_ to offer help even when not asked, _and_ knowing when to back off when help is not accepted.

## <span class="bookmark" id="contribution"></span>Effectiveness of Contribution
It is not enough that you write lots of code, the point of writing code is to solve a problem. What is the size of the problems you solve for the business?

Most companies require their Senior Engineers to be capable of solving "medium to large problems" independently. But this definition is loaded, because every company defines "medium to large" differently. Some companies take this to mean handling entire business domains, where others only need Senior Engineers to be able to handle a system component well. To understand whether you're contributing at the scope of a Senior Engineer, you need to talk to your manager.

## <span class="bookmark" id="consistency"></span>Consistency
If you're already demonstrating all the traits above, but sometimes making the mark and sometimes missing it, then don't be in a rush to become a Senior Engineer. It takes time to attain and demonstrate consistency, and sometimes it's better to remain at your current level than to jump to the next one.

As a rule of thumb, I usually wait for engineers to demonstrate consistency in all the traits above, for multiple projects and at least half a year, before setting them up for promotion into Senior Engineer. So if you think you're doing it all, but your manager says "continue doing what you're doing", consistency may be what they're looking for.

## <span class="bookmark" id="known_for"></span>(Bonus) Known for "something"
This is a bonus because most places don't care about this, but if you have something here, it will help you a lot.

Being known for "something" gives everybody a talking point about you. When people know that you're strong in "something", you'll automatically be the first person they look for when they need help at that.

"Something" can literally be anything, and it doesn't have to be just technical. These are some examples I've encountered:
- "She's extremely thorough when testing her changes"
- "He can fix production incidents very quickly"
- "She can pick up a component nobody understands and start make changes within a day"
- "He can find the right person to ask for help very quickly even within a large 5000 person organization"

I believe that every Senior Engineer needs to have at least "something" to be known for, because this is your unique value proposition to the team and company. If there's nothing that sets you apart from other Senior Engineers, then I can easily replace you with another Senior Engineer with a "something" to increase the value proposition of the overall team.

# Are you ready?
I hope you learned something about what it takes to make this next step to becoming a Senior Software Engineer. Remember, this is just a guide! The important thing is to work with your manager to create clear goals for you, because their list may be different from mine.
