Congratulations! You've graduated from a CS bootcamp, and you've found a nice paying little job. What's next?

Most bootcamps exist to equip you with just enough knowledge to start contributing to a company right away.

But in order to become a Senior Software Engineer, start studying again. If you truly want to grow your career in Software Engineering, then show that you really know your stuff.
